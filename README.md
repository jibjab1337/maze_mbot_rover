# maze_mbot_rover
## A Makeblot rover that can get through a very basic maze and play a tune<br />
Model: Makeblot Mbot<br />
The rover has one ultrasonic sensor that pans 180 degrees and moves into open space<br />
The finish line is a black tape. The Mbot's infrared sensors will detect black colors and play a tune when it arrives at the finish line<br />
### Note: The maze course is very simple, no dead-ends. Just one serpentine path. Future updates should allow for corrections. Must also be of a light color so that the rover doesn't get confused about where the finish line is<br />
